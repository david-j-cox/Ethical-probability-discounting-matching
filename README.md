# Ethical-probability-discounting-matching

This repository contains the raw data and the notebook used to author the manuscript titled, "Choice with Ethical Outcomes: Sign Effect, Commodity Effect, & Ethical Theory Preference". It is currently under peer review. Here is the accompanying abstract: 

Researchers have found significant utility in approaching choice from a behavioral economics lens. Recently, this framework has begun to be extended to the description and prediction of clinical-ethical choice. Here, researchers have found that common behavioral economics effects occur with clinical-ethical choice at the group level (e.g., framing effects, effort discounting, delay and probability discounting) and at the individual level (probability discounting). The current study sought to examine: the sign effect in ethical probability discounting, the commodity effect between monetary and ethical outcomes, and correlations among rates of monetary and ethical discounting, probability matching with money, and ethical theory preference. We observed: a sign effect with ethical outcomes consistent with past probability discounting research; a commodity effect with monetary outcomes discounted more steeply than ethical outcomes; no significant correlations among discounting tasks; and one of 12 statistically significant correlations between ethical theory preference and ethical discounting. In total, the present work further demonstrates the presence of behavioral economics effects with ethical decision-making. However, choice with ethical outcomes may not easily be predicted by choice with other commodities, measures in behavioral economics, or ethical theory preference.
